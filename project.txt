A Market Place for Open Science Project

There are many different open science and open-source projects and tools, 
but no efficient way to match project creators with interested collaborators 
who possess the skills required to contribute. 


Your challenge is to create a solution that will help people 
who are looking for open-source projects to work on and project 
creators who need skilled contributors to find each other and communicate.
